# Research and Data Projects

This page contains a list of projects I have conducted that fall under 2 categories:
+ **Research Projects** - select published work; these will be linked as RPub pages due to restricted access to the raw data
+ **Data Projects** - for fun; these are freely available on my GitHub

## Research Projects

1. Compiling 27 separate datasets to build hierarchical multiple regression models to examine whether having siblings predicts better "mind-reading" abilities (Lo & Mar, under review).
2. Structural equation models to examine the effects of "exotic threat" racism on psychosocial health of East Asian Americans and Canadians during COVID-19 (Lo et al., under review).

## Data Projects
1. Songs with names in them: do they subsequently increase popularity of the name? Or are they simply a product of the name's popularity during that time?
2. Text analyses with the Harry Potter book series.
