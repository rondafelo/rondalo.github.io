# Research and Data Projects

This page contains a list of projects I have conducted that fall under 2 categories:
+ **Research Projects** - based off data from my (select) published work
+ **Data Projects** - based off freely available datasets

## Research Projects
*Note.* These projects are linked as RPub pages due to restricted access to the raw data.

1. Having siblings promotes better social cognitive "mind-reading" abilities (Lo & Mar, under review).
2. The effects of racism on psychosocial health of East Asian Americans and Canadians during COVID-19 (Lo et al., under review).
3. Siblings whose personalities are similar tend to have better personal well-being and sibling relationship quality (Lo et al., under review).

## Data Projects
1. Songs with names in them: do they subsequently increase popularity of the name? Or are they simply a product of the name's popularity during that time?
2. Text analyses with the Harry Potter book series.
